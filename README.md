# Neural Unveil: Journey into Layer Activations
 
The project focuses on visualizing the activation patterns of neurons within a neural network by generating heatmaps for each individual neuron. This approach helps reveal how neurons respond to different inputs and the regions within the network that are most active during processing. By plotting the heatmaps of all the neurons, we can gain deeper insights into how the network processes information at different layers.

Each heatmap provides a visual representation of the activation values for a specific neuron when a particular input is fed into the network. This allows us to identify key areas of the network that contribute the most to the decision-making process, potentially highlighting neurons that specialize in recognizing specific patterns or features within the data.

By aggregating the heatmaps of all neurons across different layers, the project aims to create a comprehensive view of the neural network's inner workings, offering a better understanding of how data flows and is transformed throughout the network. This visualization technique can be particularly useful for debugging and refining neural network architectures, as it allows researchers and practitioners to identify underperforming or overactive neurons and adjust the model accordingly.
